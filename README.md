## Functionality

This is a simple example of "Inline edit options" in react based web application. In this repo, the React components are implemented as follows:

(1) A react component that let us update a course details (online course) through multiple inline edit options. (2) A component to implement a common "input field" for inline edit options. (3) A component to implement a common "textarea input" field for inline edit options, (4) A component to list all the courses.

Note: As it's an example, only a limited number of data properties are used for simplicity - there can be many more and with complex structure.

## API Calls

This is a simple PATCH API call example with real world scenario. When we want to edit data items to the DB through web applications, we send PUT (all fields) or PATCH (partial or only a few fields) requests from the frontend that target the concerned backend APIs.

Note: Here, PATCH API has been used for the partial updates (frontend - inline edit options).
